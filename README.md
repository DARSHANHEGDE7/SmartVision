SmartVision: Real-Time Monitoring and Detection of Suspicious Human Activity Using Deep Learning
📌 Abstract
SmartVision is an AI-powered security system designed to monitor and detect suspicious human activities in real-time. Using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques, the system analyzes surveillance footage to identify complex human behaviors, threats, and aggressive actions. Built on cutting-edge technologies like SlowFast for activity classification, YOLOv5 for real-time threat detection, and MediaPipe for pose estimation, SmartVision provides a robust solution for public and private space security.

🚀 Features
🔍 Real-Time Suspicious Activity Detection: Identifies complex human behaviors using SlowFast.
🛡 Threat Detection: Uses YOLOv5 to detect high-risk scenarios like weapons, accidents, and explosions.
💪 Pose Estimation: Leverages MediaPipe to detect physical confrontations or aggressive movements.
📊 Activity Classification: Differentiates between typical and suspicious activities with ResNet50.
🛠 Real-Time Alerts: Sends immediate notifications to authorities when a potential threat is detected.
⚙ Technologies Used
Deep Learning:

SlowFast: Activity classification from slow and fast video frames.
ResNet50: Recognizes activity patterns to distinguish between normal and suspicious behavior.
YOLOv5: Detects high-risk scenarios in real-time.
