SmartVision 🚀
Real-Time Monitoring and Detection of Suspicious Human Activity Using Deep Learning

📌 Abstract
SmartVision is an AI-powered security system designed to monitor and detect suspicious human activities in real-time. Leveraging advanced Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques, the system analyzes surveillance footage to identify:

Complex human behaviors

Potential threats

Aggressive actions

By integrating cutting-edge technologies like SlowFast for activity classification, YOLOv5 for real-time threat detection, and MediaPipe for pose estimation, SmartVision delivers a robust and efficient solution for enhancing security in both public and private spaces.
